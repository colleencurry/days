Given the poem:
Thirty days hath September
April, June, and November
All the rest have thirty-one
with February's 28 to make it fun.
Leap Year happening one in four, Gives February o ne  day more.
Write a program that does the following:
1.  Prompts the user for a month string (January, February, ...).   Validate the input month string against an array of month's, and prompt the user again if the String entered is not a valid month.  Note:  You may want to use an Enum.
2. Prompts the user for a year (e.g. 2016) only if the month is February. 
3. For months with 31 days, output the phrase "all the rest have thirty-one".  For September, the phrase "Thirty days hath September".   For April, June, and November the phrase "April, June, and November".  For February, if the year is not a leap year, output the phrase "with February's 28 to make it fun.".   If the use did supply a leap year (and the user supplied February as the month), output the phrase "Leap Year happening one in four, Gives February o ne  day more."
4.Note.  Since CISS110 covers Arrays and   ArrayList  objects, I expect your solution to use these classes.  How you do that is up to you. (after all, this is your program :) ), so I am not making specific requirements except that you demonstrate your knowledge of chapter 7.
Please make sure you comment your code thoroughly. You are expected to use javadoc comments at the top of your code and above every method other than main.  Refer to examples in the text or research javadoc on line if you have questions.
The code should be nicely formatted and should use proper variables.
You will post a link to your video  here and you should also upload your source code.
The video  should have the following items:
1) You should start by showing the comments in your code that include your name, the class, and what the assignment is.
2) You should show all of your code. Slowly scroll through your code.
3) You must show your code compiling.
4) You must show your code running and completely test your program. If there are special inputs or outputs your program should check, please make sure you detail that your program can handle it.
5) If there is anything special you added to the program then please detail it.
You should keep your screen cast short (5 minutes or less is preferred and definitely no more than 10) so please make sure you are concise while covering the required information. You may have to practice your screen capture a few times to get this right.
To receive credit you MUST submit your source files and a Link to your video after uploading it to screencast.com.
